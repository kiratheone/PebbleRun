# Background Service Reliability and Edge Case Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for background service reliability and edge case handling in the PebbleRun Pebble 2 HR companion app. This documentation satisfies **TASK-054**: Test background service reliability and edge cases.

## Background Service Architecture

### Service Responsibilities

The PebbleRun background service is responsible for:
- **Continuous Workout Tracking**: Maintaining workout sessions when app is backgrounded
- **Data Persistence**: Ensuring workout data is saved even during system interruptions
- **Device Communication**: Maintaining Pebble connection and data synchronization
- **System Resource Management**: Adapting to device resource constraints
- **Error Recovery**: Handling crashes, network issues, and system pressure

### Service States and Transitions

```
STOPPED → STARTING → RUNNING → STOPPING → STOPPED
                        ↓
                    SUSPENDED (system pressure)
                        ↓
                    RECOVERING → RUNNING
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Android Background Service Testing

#### Doze Mode and App Standby
```kotlin
// Test service behavior in Android Doze mode
@Test
fun `service adapts to doze mode restrictions`() {
    // Simulate device entering doze mode
    // Verify service uses appropriate wake strategies
    // Confirm critical data is preserved
}
```

#### Background Execution Limits
- **Target SDK Considerations**: Compliance with background execution limits
- **Foreground Service Usage**: Appropriate use of foreground service for workouts
- **Work Manager Integration**: Background tasks for non-critical operations

#### Battery Optimization Whitelist
```kotlin
@Test
fun `service requests battery optimization exemption`() {
    // Verify service detects optimization restrictions
    // Confirm user guidance for whitelist addition
    // Test service behavior when not whitelisted
}
```

### iOS Background Processing

#### Background App Refresh
```kotlin
// Test service behavior with Background App Refresh disabled
@Test
fun `service adapts to background refresh restrictions`() {
    // Simulate Background App Refresh disabled
    // Verify graceful degradation
    // Confirm user notification of limitations
}
```

#### Background Processing Categories

- **Adaptations**: 
  - Reduced sampling frequency
  - Local-only data storage
  - Minimal UI updates
- **User Communication**: Clear indication of reduced functionality

#### Service Recovery Hierarchy
```
1. Continue with reduced functionality
2. Restart service components
3. Full service restart
4. User notification and manual restart
```

### 2. Data Preservation Strategies

#### Multi-Level Persistence
```kotlin
// Primary: Real-time database updates
repository.updateSession(session)

// Secondary: Local cache backup
cache.store(session)

// Tertiary: Emergency local storage
emergencyStore.save(session.toMinimalData())
```

#### Recovery Mechanisms

- **App Restart**: Recover incomplete sessions
- **Device Restart**: Restore from persistent storage

### 3. User Experience Continuity

#### Seamless Recovery
- **Automatic Recovery**: No user intervention required for common issues
- **Transparent Operation**: User unaware of background service restarts
- **Data Integrity**: Complete workout data regardless of interruptions

#### Error Communication
